Is there a difference between this text and some nonsense like ``Huardest gefburn''? Kjift – not at all!  \cnote{this needs a ref}
A blind text like this gives you information about the selected font, how the letters are written and \pnote{wtf?} an impression of the look.
This text should contain all letters of the alphabet and it should be written \mnote{in of}{typo! check this stuff!} the original language. 
There is no need for special content, but the length of words should match the language.
